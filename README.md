A lightweight and customizable popup plugin for WordPress. Add buttons, images, and personalize colors — no coding required.

== Description ==

**AAGTP Popup Maker** allows you to create responsive, customizable popups with ease. You can add an image, style your CTA button, and control layout settings using a simple admin interface.

Use it to create modals for promotions, announcements, or call-to-actions — all without touching code.

⚠️ **This plugin is currently a prototype.** While fully functional for basic use, more advanced features such as trigger conditions, session limits, and prebuilt templates are planned for future updates.

👨‍💻 **Please note:** This plugin is developed and maintained by a solo developer as a personal project. While I intend to improve and maintain it over time, support may be limited or delayed.
